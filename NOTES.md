Need to take a good serious look at miniplex [https://github.com/hmans/miniplex] (forked to https://github.com/jbowwww/miniplex).
Seems to be exactly what I struggled to express in Typescript.

If it is missing anything I require for this project (iff), it may be some slight modifications to work with/from a db (for now mongo), isntead of an in memory collection.
